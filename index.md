## *üìö* Education

I did my undergraduate studies at MIT in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering and 
Quantum Information and Computation.

I then followed up with an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Masters focusing on Complexity Theory and Device Physics.

Over my time at MIT, I took a wide range of classes that cover language models and computer vision, quantum devices and computing,
complexity theory, FPGA and CPU design, semiconductor physics, image processing, control theory and product design.

## *üçé* Teaching Experience

I taught several courses during my time at MIT, including:

#### 2.00b - <span class="emoji-word toy-design">Toy Design</span>

I was a mentor MIT's Mechanical Engineering departments Toy Design class. In the class
students have to design and build toys using shop tools, circuits and microcontrollers.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### 6.004 - <span class="emoji-word computation-structures">Computation Structures</span>

I was a lab assistant for "Computation Structures." The class covers assembly and the RISC-V processor architecture, the labs include HDL and assembly code where students get to build their own
RISC-V processor and run algorithms on it.
As an LA, I worked on testing labs and the backbones of the processor. I also helped teach students concepts
such as processor cycles and timing, combinatoric and sequential logic, memory hierarchy, processor pipelining and processor design tradeoffs.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### 6.002 - <span class="emoji-word circuits-and-electronics">Circuits and Electronics</span>

I was a lab assistant for "Circuits and Electronics" where I got the chance to help students understand circuit analysis, op-amp applications, and transistors. As a lab assistant, testing out labs, debugging circuits, helping students understand concepts taught in class and giving them check-offs as they worked in lab were part of my duties.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### MIT ESP class - <span class="emoji-word splash-class">Making Code Hard(ly Work)</span>

I also got the chance to teach a programming class to high schoolers with my friend Savoldy
in MIT's Educational Studies Program in a class we called (excuse the pun) "[Making Code Hard(ly Work)](https://github.com/itstorque/MIT-Splash-2019-Making-Code-Hardly-Work)."
In the class we teach good programming practices by showing them bad meme-y code, interesting debug problems that arise from poorly structured code,
and exercises where they get to write their own bad code.

## *üî¨* Research

I was involved in several research projects at Microsoft and MIT spanning AI, CS and Quantum Computing, including:

#### Language Models for Code, Predictive Simulations and Device Design


{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### Computer Vision Models for Quantum Device Characterization

Developing
{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### NN-based Interpolation using Frame Interpolation

{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### GPU Kernel Development for *QuantumClifford.jl*

I developed custom CUDA kernels to speed up quantum stabilizer formalism simulations by a factor of ~100 on GPUs
for [the Quantum Photonics Group's](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/) quantum simulation package [*QuantumClifford.jl*](https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl).
{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### ML-based Control of Spin Quantum Memories

I developed an ML-based methodology for optimal control of spin-based qubits. This involved developing a fast physics-solver in tensorflow and a gradient optimization for continuous pulses. 
We published a paper showcasing the method working experimentally that enables us to scale the control 3 orders of magnitude larger than the previous state-of-the-art.
{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### Electro-Thermal Modeling of Superconducting Materials

At QNN, I developed mathematical methods and implemented an electro-thermal model
in Python to efficiently simulate superconducting wires and superconducting
nanowire single photon detector (SNSPDs). This is typically a hard problem since
these devices are highly non-linear and solving both the thermal and electrical
parts of a model is very complex - let alone making it fast.

### A collection of other random projects

- [performer](https://github.com/itstorque/performer): Music, Instrument and MIDI synthesis tool in python. Supposed to be a python replacement for Max/MSP and puredata.
- [ltspice-tikz](https://github.com/itstorque/ltspice-tikz): A one-night project to convert LTspice circuit and symbol files into LaTeX pgp/tikz code. Hopefully people have no excuses to publish ugly looking circuits now.
- [spice-daemon](https://github.com/itstorque/spice-daemon): A toolkit that spawns alongside LTspice and adds functionality on top of LTspice. It can adds true noise generation, solve diff. eq.'s and adds a new level of parametrization not available in LTspice through python. Designed to suit the needs of people in my lab.
- [RCSJ-Washboard-Potential](https://github.com/itstorque/RCSJ-Washboard-Potential): A MATLAB visualization of washboard potentials you get by solving the RCSJ differential equation.
- [cookie-hijacker-chrome](https://github.com/itstorque/cookie-hijacker-chrome): A weekend project with a friend to develop a malicious chrome extension that steals a users cookies and passwords.
- [jekyll-shell-theme](https://github.com/itstorque/jekyll-shell-theme): A weekend project that makes jekyll webpages look like a shell. 
- [dumb-anyconnect](https://github.com/itstorque/dumb-anyconnect): A tweak that hooks into the Cisco AnyConnect app and adds a connection to the iOS keychain. A one-night project born out of the frustration of hacing to type my password everytime I want to use a VPN.
- [assistivetech.mit.edu](https://github.com/itstorque/assistivetech.mit.edu): A PHP website written from scratch for MIT's assistive technology hackathon with a hacker management backend.
- [QuickTimeVNC](https://github.com/itstorque/QuickTimeVNC): A python script that allows VNC like control of a jailbroken iPhone over QuickTime.
- [BetterCCBattery](https://github.com/itstorque/BetterCCBattery) and [OrientationControl](https://github.com/itstorque/OrientationControl): iOS tweaks that modify the user experience with the control center and orientation lock.
