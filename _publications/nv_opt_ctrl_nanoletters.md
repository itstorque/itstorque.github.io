abstract: "A central goal in many quantum information processing applications is a network of quantum memories that can be entangled with each other while being individually controlled and measured with high fidelity. This goal has motivated the development of programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with integrated spin quantum memories using diamond color center spin-photon interfaces. However, this approach introduces a challenge into the microwave control of individual spins within closely packed registers. Here, we present a quantum memory-integrated photonics platform capable of (i) the integration of multiple diamond color center spins into a cryogenically compatible, high-speed programmable PIC platform, (ii) selective manipulation of individual spin qubits addressed via tunable magnetic field gradients, and (iii) simultaneous control of qubits using numerically optimized microwave pulse shaping. The combination of localized optical control, enabled by the PIC platform, together with selective spin manipulation opens the path to scalable quantum networks on intrachip and interchip platforms."
