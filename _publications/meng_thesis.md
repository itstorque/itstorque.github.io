abstract: "As the size of superconducting nanowire devices increases and the influence of second-order effects, such as thermal or electrostatic coupling, becomes more significant, the complexity of models required to accurately and efficiently simulate the deviceâ€™s behavior becomes more challenging. Traditional circuit simulators used for superconducting devices tend to focus on frequency-domain simulation and are not optimized for simulating superconducting nanowire geometries in the time-domain. This thesis presents an integrated simulator environment designed with the goal of simulating superconducting nanowires. The work presented in this thesis introduces: 1. an integrated environment for SPICE software that extends its modeling capabilities optimized for superconducting nanowire devices and accompanying experiments; 2. a simple procedure to measure the stability of circuit models used to present an improved nanowire SPICE model; and 3. an efficient Julia-based simulator optimized for superconducting nanowire devices and nonlinear microwave circuits."
