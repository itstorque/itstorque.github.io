# Beginnings of a blog

For about 10 months now, I've been meaning to start documenting my projects via blog
form. What better reason than my birthday to start a commitment to post a write-up
of some of my projects on a blog.

## Why has it taken me so long to start?

Well, this question boils down to a few silly self-inflicted reasons üòÖ

1. **Finite time, not-so-finite projects**: I spawn personal projects at an unsustainable rate that de-prioritizes spending time on a well-written write-up.
2. **Figures**: I hold myself to high standards when it comes to making figures that explain a concept succinctly and "beautifully".
3. **CSS shennanigans**: As a full-stack engineer who cares to work on projects that span a wide breadth of topics, I enjoy writing CSS (a somewhat unpopular opinion from what I gather?) and have decided to write my own sites code relying minimally on other packages. I apparently chose to use no CSS frameworks at all... yeesh!
4. **Finishing a project**: Choosing an end-point for a personal project is... hard. I choose to work on these problems because they are interesting, and this predisposition means that its hard for them to cease being interesting. Typically, as part of trying to solve a problem, I (just as everyone else does) tend to stumble across 50 other problems and ways of thinking about the same problem. Choosing an end-point and being able to write a post without entertaining the thoughts of novel ideas and solutions is an up-hill battle.

## What this means for the blog

For (1),
- don't focus too much on the quality


# Contents of the blog

# Blog Infrastructure

The scaffolding for this site is pretty simple: Jekyll site with plain css. I designed some custom layouts and building blocks, js code, etc. Here are my favorite highlights:

- Apple-Style Emojis: Lazy load and replace every emoji character on a webpage dynamically with the iOS style version of the emoji ü•π. ‚Üê Do it! Inspect element this emoji!
- Theme engine: Cookie-enabled theme storage with multiple themes. Hit the dice 5+ times for a *~barebones~* dropdown menu. You can also open developer tools, find a theme class name (e.g. `.default` or `.dark_pistachio`) and change the colors üé®üòÄ.
- Hidden interactive quirks: they wouldn't be hidden if I told you where they are.
