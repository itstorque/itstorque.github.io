#### Masters Degree

For my masters, I am leveraging mathematical methods to approach several different problems
when it comes to simulating, designing, fabricating and testing superconducting nanoelectronics.
These electronics are tiny and are cooled down below 4 Kelvin. Through their highly non-linear 
behaviour, we can design a range of cool devices including a single photon detector and a
single photon imager!

- I build efficient julia simulators for large-scale networks of non-linear superconducting devices. 
<!-- The goal is being able to simulate millions of devices, where the smallest deviceis thousands of LC elements in less than a minute! To do that, I spend a lot of time finding symmteries and exploiting them and utilizing cool methods such as harmonic balance for frequency domain precomputation. -->
- Build tools on top of existing simulators (like LTspice) that exploit them to give them new 
features and speed them up. See my project [spice-daemon](https://github.com/itstorque/spice-daemon).
- Designing a new optimal scheme to characterize fabrication defects in superconducting electronics.
- Apply various mathematical tools ranging from gradient descent to space filling curves to design better
devices.

#### Undergraduate Degree

I double majored at MIT graduating with a
B.S. in <span class="bold ee-color">Electrical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold cs-color">Computer Science</span> and a
B.S. in <span class="bold meche-color">Mechanical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold quantum-color">Quantum Information and Computation</span>.

Over my time at MIT, I took a wide range of classes that cover quantum & information theory, quantum computing
platforms, theoretical computer science, FPGA design, processor design, semiconductor physics, image processing, controls, thermofluids, mechanics and product design.
